## UX Design

At the outset of the project, I created the following wireframe designs using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/):

## Database Schema

The planning and design of the wireframes helped me to decide on the database schema I would need, and this was created using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/):

## Features & User Story Planning

In order to plan the project, I used agile methodologies.  I created a project kanban board and populated it with a number of user stories (see below), based on the following epics.


I decided on three iterations for the project.  My main aim for the first iteration was to complete most of the user stories, while the second iteration would focus more on, and the third iteration would focus more on testing the website and completing documentation.  I used MoSCow prioritisation to prioritise the user stories and tasks in each iteration.  I estimated user stories and tasks based on the following user story since I thought it was one of the smallest pieces of work to be undertaken.  Giving this an estimate of one story point, I estimated other user stories relative to this one using a Fibonnaci sequence.

![Baseline for estimates]()

Since I had no 'velocity' measures to use to give an indication of how many story points I could complete in an iteration, I estimated, based on my baseline user story, that I could complete 50 story points per iteration.  As such, I ensured that iteration one included no more than 30 story points (60%) that were MUST HAVE or SHOULD HAVE priorities.  The kanban board for iteration one at the outset looked like this:

![Iteration 1 Start a](documentation/iteration_1_start_a.png)
![Iteration 1 Start b](documentation/iteration_1_start_b.png)
![Iteration 1 Start c](documentation/iteration_1_start_c.png)

Towards the end of Iteration 1, I found that I had completed all of the tasks and user stories for the iteration, but I had no time left spare.

Based on my velocity measure for Iteration 1, for Iteration 2, I included user stories totalling 5o story points, with MUST HAVE and SHOULD HAVE priorities totalling ? story points (less than 60%):

At the end of Iteration 2, however, I found that I did not have time to complete the following user stories, and I moved them back to the backlog.  In Iteration 2, I completed ? story points.

For Iteration 3 I included user stories totally ? story points with MUST HAVE and SHOULD HAVE priorities totalling ? story points (less than 60%):

![Iteration 3 Start a](documentation/iteration_3_start_a.png)
![Iteration 3 Start b](documentation/iteration_3_start_b.png)

At the end of Iteration 3, I completed all of the user stories except for two, which I marked as won't do and moved back to the backlog:

## Local Development
Gitpod was used as the IDE for local development of the application and GitHub was used for version control.

## Testing
For details of all testing performed, including validator testing and manual testing, please see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).  This also includes details of bugs found and resolved throughout the development process.

## Forking

If you would like to work on this code you can click on the repository here (https://github.com/Jem212Mac/the-crafty-quilt-company) and click on 'Fork' to create your own fork of the code to work on.

## Deployment

The application was deployed to Heroku.  In order to deploy to Heroku, the following steps were performed:

1. 'pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1' was used in the IDE terminal to install a production ready webserver for Heroku.
2. The command 'Pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' was used in the IDE terminal in order to create a requirements.txt file which included the dependencies for the project.  Heroku needs this file to install the required dependencies before the application is run.
3. A Procfile containing 'web: gunicorn gabbygourmand.wsgi' was created in the root of the project directory.
4. ,'.herokuapp.com' was added to the allowed hosts in the project settings.py file.
5. I created a new Heroku account here: (https://id.heroku.com/login).
6. From the Heroku dashboard I clicked 'Create new app' and input a unique name for the app, a region, and clicked 'create app'.
7. I clicked on the Settings tab and went to the Config Vars section.
8. I added the appropriate details to Config Vars.
9. I clicked on the 'Deploy' tab, chose Github as my deployment method, and searched for my github repository to connect.
10. For this project I chose to automatically deploy with every git push.

## Future Enhancements

Given more time there are a number of enhancements I would like to make to the website:
1. I would allow Sign Up or Sign In with social media accounts.
