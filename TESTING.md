## Manual Testing

### User Story Testing

User story testing was performed throughout site development, for each new feature, before it was merged into the master file.  User story testing was based primarily on the acceptance criteria for each of the user stories.

User Story []().

## Usability / User Acceptance Testing

In addition to the testing I performed throughout the developement process which was primarily based around the user stories and the acceptance criteria (as detailed above), I also performed some exploratory testing based on the following user journeys with the goal of ensuring that the site would meet the expectations of a user in terms of ease of use, ease of navigation, responsiveness of buttons and links etc.  My aim was to ensure that user's would have a pleasant experience interacting with the site and that the overall display of content to the user was appropriate and appealing (clear, clean and uncluttered).

1. 

All input fields / forms were checked with both positive and negative tests to ensure that users could not submit empty fields, and that feedback to the user was appropriate.

## Browser Testing

The site was tested on the below browsers, without issue:
1. Chrome
2. Safari

## Device Testing / Responsive Testing

The site was tested throughout the developement process to ensure that it is fully responsive using chrome development tools.  Each page of the site was checked at each of the break points to ensure that the design and layout looked good.  I also tested the site at points between the usual breakpoints.

Testing was also performed on the following devices to ensure that the site was fully responsive:
1. Samsung Galaxy Flip mobile phone.
2. Samsung Galaxy Tab A7.
3. Standard Laptop.
4. Widescreen monitor.
